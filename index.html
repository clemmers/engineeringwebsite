        [9/2/22] This week we worked on tinker cad.<br>
            We chose a household item to model, and tried to replicate it in tinkercad. I chose a bidet, and tried my best to replicate it (above)
            We are also working on creating a Rube Goldberg machine using a combination of basic machines. The objective is to start with a baseball and end by popping a balloon with a needle.

        [9/9/22] This week we worked on making a rube goldberg machine in tinkercad. A rube goldberg machine manipulates a chain reaction of multiple simple machines to complete a simple task in an overly complicated way.<br>

        [9/16/22] This week we continued to work on making the rube goldberg machine. We starte cutting out pieces with cardboard. We also competed in a Paper Boat Challenge in which we made a boat out of paper and tried to make it hold the most amount of weight for the greatest amount of time. We lost because we accidentally created holes in the bottom of our boat while folding it together, and it sunk almost immediately. (above)<br>

        [9/23/22] This week we finished the rube goldberg machine, and it worked (video above)<br>

        [9/30/22] This week I designed a prosthetic leg for a kangaroo. It is to be made out of carbon fiber (image attatched above) <br>

     <p>
        [10/20/22] This week my team and I deisgned, created and launched a bottle rocket. We used hot glue to add fins and a cone to the bottle to help with the aerodynamics. We also used the reaction between baking soda and vinegar to help propel our rocket further. (Above)  <br>

    <p>
        [10/27/22] This week I learned about enviornmental science, and how it is impliemnted in our everyday lives. We made water filters out of rocks and sand (above). the filter works because all of the dirty particles in the water get caught in the layers of rock as it trickles down<br>

    <p>[11/04/22] This week we started learing about electrical engineering. We learned the fundamentals of electrical enginnering, including basic terms like voltage, current, and resistance. We learned what resistors are, and how they limit the current of electricity in a circuit. We learned how to calculate the required resistance in a circuit using Ohms law, V=IR. We practiced Ohms law and applied what we learned by creating basic circuits using resistors and LEDs on a virtual breadboard in tinkercad. I created two circuits, one with resistors in parallel, and the other with resistors in series. (images attatched above)</p>
