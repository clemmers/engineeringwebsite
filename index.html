        [9/2/22] This week we worked on tinker cad.<br>
            We chose a household item to model, and tried to replicate it in tinker cad. I chose a bidet, and tried my best to replicate it (above)
            We are also working on creating a Rub Goldberg machine using a combination of basic machines. The objective is to start with a baseball and end by popping a balloon with a needle
